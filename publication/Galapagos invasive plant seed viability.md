abstract= "In the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador, we investigated how the seed viability of important invasive plant species was affected by processing and digestion by endemic birds, namely, Galapagos Mockingbirds (Nesomimus parpulus), and Medium (Geospiza fontis) and Small (G. fuliginosa) ground finches. Multiple feeding trials were carried out on five captive birds of each species. They were fed amaranthus (Amaranthus dubius), passion fruit (Passiflora edulis), blackberry (Rubus niveus), guava (Psidium guajava), sauco (Cestrum auriculatum), and lantana (Lantana camara). The Galapagos Mockingbird is likely to be an effective disperser of invasive plants, as it defecated seeds of all species except amaranthus, without lowering their viability. Seeds were retained in the gut for an average of 87 min. Mockingbirds ate fruit in more of the trials than did the finches. Finches are confirmed as seed predators as they generally crushed seeds before ingesting them. Only one intact viable blackberry seed was defecated by a Small Ground Finch. All three bird species were observed moving fruit (and seeds) around their cages while feeding. Seed dispersal over short distances could happen in this way."
