abstract= "Karyotype evolution in species with non-localised centromeres (holocentric chromosomes) is usually very dynamic and associated with recurrent fission and fusion (also termed agmatoploidy/symploidy) events. In *Rhynchospora* (Cyperaceae), one of the most species-rich sedge genera, all analysed species have holocentric chromosomes and their numbers range from 2n = 4 to 2n = 84. Agmatoploidy/symploidy and polyploidy were suggested as the main processes in the reshuffling of *Rhynchospora* karyotypes, although testing different scenarios of chromosome number evolution in a phylogenetic framework has not been attempted until now. Here, we used maximum likelihood and model-based analyses, in combination with genome size estimation and ribosomal DNA distribution, to understand chromosome evolution in *Rhynchospora*. Overall, chromosome number variation showed a significant phylogenetic signal and the majority of the lineages maintained a karyotype of 2n = 10 (~48% of the species), the most likely candidate for the ancestral number of the genus. Higher and lower chromosome numbers were restricted to specific clades, whilst polyploidy and/or fusion/fission events were present in specific branches. Variation in genome size and ribosomal DNA site number showed no correlation with ploidy level or  chromosome number. Although different mechanisms of karyotype evolution (polyploidy, fusion and fission) seem to be acting in distinct lineages, the degree of chromosome variation and the main mechanisms involved are comparable to those found in some monocentric genera and lower than expected for a holocentric genus."
