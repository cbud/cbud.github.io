abstract= "The Prevention, Control and Management of Invasive Alien Species in the Pacific Islands project (project number GFL 3664, the IAS project), commenced in September 2012 and was due for completion on 30 September 2016. The project was designed to provide support to Pacific Island countries in their national efforts to implement the Guidelines for Invasive Species Management in the Pacific. Nine Pacific Island countries originally participated in the Pacific IAS project, these being the Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Niue, Palau, Samoa, Tonga and Vanuatu. A terminal evaluation covers the design and implementation phases of the IAS Project. A nice summary of what the project acheived is available from [SPREP](http://www.sprep.org/publications/battling-invasive-species-in-the-pacific-outcomes-of-the-regional-gef-pas-ias-project/). Chris Buddenhagen was a consultant hired by SPREP to write this document."
