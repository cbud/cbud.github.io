abstract= "We present survey questions useful for describing agricultural seed systems. The questions are designed so that they can be used for standardized comparisons among seed systems, addressing both networks for seed movement and networks for the communication of information related to variety selection and integrated pest management. This approach provides information that can be used in multilayer network analyses of how information influences seed system success. Also provided are example data sheets with field descriptors that should provide for straightforward statistical analysis after data collection."
