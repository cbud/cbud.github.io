abstract= "Growth and survival of kohekohe (Dysoxylum spectabile) seedlings planted in forest gaps and in non-gap micro-environments were monitored in Kauaeranga valley, near Thames, New Zealand. Seedlings in gaps and on gap edges grew faster than seedlings in darker forest environments. Seedlings protected from vertebrate browsing (mostly possum) grew faster and survived better than unprotected seedlings. Although browse appeared to be the primary cause of mortality, disease and damage from falling debris were also significant."
