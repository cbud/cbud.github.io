I have been involved in writing invasive species and weed control strategies, plans and proposals implemented in Hawaii, Galapagos, New Zealand and the South Pacific. This has involved collecting information about the distribution of introduced and invasive species, monitoring methods for weed control efforts, assessments of control and eradication efficacy and costs.
