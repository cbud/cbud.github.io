# Biography

I am currently a post-doctoral scholar at AgResearch in Hamilton, New Zealand in Forage Science. We are investigating problems of herbicide resistant weeds. I was recently a post-doctoral researcher in the Plant Pathology Department at the University of Florida ([CV](pdf/BuddenhagenHighlightsCV20170817.pdf)). I completed my PhD with [Austin Mast](http://mastlab.org) at Florida State University in 2016. I also spent a few years working as a curator in the [herbarium](http://herbarium.bio.fsu.edu/) at FSU. A major goal of my work has been to inform and influence management and policy with respect to biosecurity, biodiversity (including systematics and evolution), and natural resources. Apart from recent work on plant phylogenomics, and systematics, my research has focused on invasive plants, animal impacts and lately the spread of plant pathogens. Prior to completing my doctorate, I gained deep experience in non-academic roles that focused on biosecurity issues related to invasive plant and animal policy and management in New Zealand, Galapagos and Hawaii. 


This site provides a non-exhaustive list of my publications. More details are provided on my [CV](pdf/BuddenhagenCV20170723.pdf).
